#### Purpose of project

The tools included in this package allow you to manipulate, display, modify, and retrieve basic
statistics on the columns of your csv data. We will be adding other tools that could be relevant for securities traders such as
back tester and possibly execution and risk tools

#### Building the project

Open the command line/terminal, navigate to a directory that you will build the project in,
and execute the following commands to build the project and create the necessary executables.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -B .
make
sudo make install
```

You can then navigate to `bin/`, which is located in the top level directory of this project to use the executables.

#### Usage and examples

There is more information [here](usage.md) on how to use the tools, as well as some examples
